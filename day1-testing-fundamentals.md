# Day 1 – Software Testing Fundamentals

- Learned the main types of Software Testing – Functional, Non-Functional, and Maintenance Testing, and understood their overall purpose in ensuring software quality and stability.

- Explored Functional Testing types – Unit, Integration, System, and Acceptance testing, with understanding of how each validates a different level of the system.

- Explored Non-Functional Testing types – Performance, Load, Stress, Security, Usability, Compatibility, Scalability, and Volume testing, understanding their role in system quality and reliability.

- Explored Maintenance Testing types – Regression, Maintenance, Impact Analysis, and Configuration testing, focusing on ensuring system stability after updates or changes.

- Studied Performance Testing in detail – Purpose, benefits, and main tools like JMeter, NeoLoad, LoadRunner, and SmartMeter.io.

- Understood key selection criteria for performance testing tools – protocol support, cost, client preference, training needs, and support policy.

- Learned the Seven Principles of Software Testing – from “testing shows the presence of defects” to “absence-of-errors fallacy,” focusing on real-world application of each.

- Understood how to apply testing principles in real projects – through risk-based testing, early testing, automation, and effective communication with stakeholders.

- Studied the V-Model in Software Testing – understanding verification and validation phases, their relationships, pros and cons, and when to use it.
