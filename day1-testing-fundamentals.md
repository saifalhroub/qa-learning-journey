# Day 1 â€“ Software Testing Fundamentals

- Learned the 7 Principles of Software Testing (testing shows defects, exhaustive testing impossible, early testing, defect clustering, pesticide paradox, context-dependent testing, absence-of-errors fallacy).

- Explored the V-Model, understanding its phases: requirements, design, coding, and corresponding testing stages (unit, integration, system, UAT).

- Key takeaway: testing starts early, aligns with each development phase, and ensures traceability between requirements and test cases.
