### âœ… How to use RTM
1. List all **requirements** of the project.
2. Assign a **Test Case** for each requirement.
3. Track the **status** of each requirement (Passed, Failed, In Progress, Not Tested).
4. Add **remarks** if needed for more details.

> RTM ensures that **no requirement is missed** and everything is properly tested.
